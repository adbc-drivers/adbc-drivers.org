Today the ADBC Drivers Contributors released a new driver for for Databricks version 0.1.0, available immediately via [dbc](https://docs.columnar.tech/dbc/). Just `dbc install databricks` to get the latest version.

The driver supports querying data, bulk ingestion, and querying the catalog (listing tables and columns and so on). Documentation can be found at [docs.adbc-drivers.org](http://docs.adbc-drivers.org/drivers/databricks/v0.1.0.html). As the version number implies, we are still working hard on adding more features, so stay tuned.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome at the repositories linked above.
