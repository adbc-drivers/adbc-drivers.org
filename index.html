    ADBC is the modern data connectivity standard built to accelerate and simplify data access for analytics
    applications. And it’s at an inflection point.
  </p>
  <p>
    More projects and organizations are embracing ADBC and looking for drivers to connect to an ever-expanding
    landscape of data systems. But there’s still much work to be done—both technical and social—to shape ADBC’s
    next era.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s why we’re launching a new initiative: the ADBC Driver Foundry. If you’re interested, please

    Where we're going, we don't need rows.
