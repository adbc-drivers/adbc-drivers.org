    ADBC is the modern data connectivity standard built to accelerate and simplify data access for analytics
    applications. And it's at an inflection point.
  </p>
  <p>
    More and more companies are using ADBC and demanding drivers for the ever-growing list of data platforms, new and
    old. But there's a lot of work that still needs to be done -- both technical and social -- to warp ADBC into its
    next era.
